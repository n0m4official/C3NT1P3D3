# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As the creator and sole maintainer of the C3NT1P3D3 project, I pledge to make participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

**Note:** This is a solo development project maintained by one person (n0m4official). All community interactions are personally moderated by me.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Sharing knowledge responsibly and ethically

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, trolling, or discriminatory comments
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Sharing exploit code or attack techniques for malicious purposes
- Encouraging or assisting in unauthorized security testing
- Using the project for illegal activities
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Ethical Security Research

Given the nature of this security tool, we have additional standards:

### Required Conduct

- **Always obtain authorization** before testing any system
- **Responsible disclosure** of any vulnerabilities found
- **Respect privacy** and confidentiality of security findings
- **Follow the law** in your jurisdiction and target jurisdiction
- **Educational focus** - share knowledge to improve security

### Prohibited Conduct

- Using the tool for unauthorized penetration testing
- Sharing findings publicly without proper disclosure process
- Weaponizing vulnerabilities for malicious purposes
- Bypassing security controls without authorization
- Targeting critical infrastructure without explicit permission

## Enforcement

As the sole maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me directly via GitHub issues (marked as "Code of Conduct Violation"). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Consequences

As the project maintainer, I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the repository, issue tracker, discussions, and any public spaces where an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, with additional provisions specific to security research tools.

## Contact
